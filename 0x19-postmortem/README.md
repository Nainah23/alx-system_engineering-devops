# My First Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration of Outage:** 
  - Start Time: January 15, 2024, 10:00 AM (EAT)
  - End Time: January 15, 2024, 1:30 PM (EAT)
- **Impact:** 
  - The web application's login and registration services were unavailable for approximately 3.5 hours.
  - Users experienced login failures and were unable to access their accounts, affecting 35% of active users during the outage period.
- **Root Cause:** 
  - Database connection pool exhaustion due to a sudden spike in user activity and inefficient query optimizations.

## Timeline

- 10:00 AM (EAT): Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a surge in database connection errors.
- 10:05 AM (EAT): Engineers started investigating potential causes, initially focusing on network issues and database server performance.
- 10:30 AM (EAT): Assumed the issue might be related to database query optimization, began analyzing query logs and execution times.
- 11:15 AM (EAT): Misleading investigation path: Initial assumption that network latency was causing connection timeouts.
- 11:45 AM (EAT): Escalated incident to the Database Operations team for further analysis and troubleshooting.
- 12:30 PM (EAT): Resolved the issue by increasing the database connection pool size and optimizing database queries.
- 1:30 PM (EAT): Services fully restored, and users regained access to the application.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause Explanation:** 
  - The issue stemmed from inefficient database query optimizations, causing the database connection pool to exhaust during peak user activity.
- **Resolution Details:** 
  - Increased the database connection pool size to accommodate higher traffic.
  - Optimized database queries to reduce execution times and alleviate database server load.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automatic scaling for database connection pools to handle sudden spikes in traffic.
  - Conduct regular performance audits and optimizations for critical database queries.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Update database connection pool configurations to allow for dynamic scaling.
  - Schedule periodic reviews of database query performance and optimization strategies.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time insights into database performance metrics.
