## Introduction
This project addresses a commonly asked interview question in software engineering about understanding the inner workings of the web stack when a user enters a URL in a browser. By breaking down each step, this project provides valuable insights into DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, firewall usage, HTTPS/SSL encryption, load balancing, web server functionality, application server operations, and database interactions.

## Tasks Overview
This README.md file is structured to guide you through completing the following tasks:
1. Explain the process of what happens when a user types "https://www.google.com" in their browser and presses Enter.
2. Create a schema illustrating the flow of the request generated by entering the URL.
3. Contribute meaningfully to the "What Happens When" GitHub repository.

Let's dive into each task in detail.

## Task 0: Explaining the Process
In Task 0, you are required to write a blog post on Medium or LinkedIn explaining the step-by-step process that occurs when a user types "https://www.google.com" and presses Enter. Your post should cover:
- DNS request
- TCP/IP communication
- Firewall usage
- HTTPS/SSL encryption
- Load balancing mechanism
- Web server functionality
- Application server operations
- Database interactions

Please ensure your blog post is written in English and provide the URL of your published post in the designated answer file.

## Task 1: Diagram Illustration
For Task 1, you need to create a schema illustrating the flow of the request when a user types "https://www.google.com" in their browser. The diagram should visually represent:
- DNS resolution
- Request hitting server IP on the appropriate port
- Encrypted traffic (HTTPS/SSL)
- Traffic passing through a firewall
- Load balancer distributing the request
- Web server responding by serving a web page
- Application server generating the web page
- Application server requesting data from the database

You can use tools like Gliffy to create the diagram. Provide the URL of your diagram image in the answer file.

## Task 2: Contribution to "What Happens When" GitHub Repository
In Task 2, you are encouraged to contribute meaningfully to the "What Happens When" GitHub repository. Submit a pull request that adds value to the existing content. Share the URL of your pull request in the answer file.

By completing these tasks, you not only enhance your technical knowledge but also contribute to a broader understanding of web stack operations.
